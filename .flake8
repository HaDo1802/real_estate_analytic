# Flake8 Configuration File
#
# WHAT: Configuration for flake8 Python linter
# WHY: Enforce consistent code style and catch common errors
# HOW: Flake8 reads this file to know what to check

[flake8]
# WHAT: Maximum line length
# WHY: Longer lines are harder to read
# HOW: Warnings for lines exceeding this length
max-line-length = 127

# WHAT: Files and directories to exclude from linting
# WHY: Don't lint generated files, dependencies, or build artifacts
# HOW: These paths are skipped during linting

# WHAT: Specific error codes to ignore
# WHY: Some rules are too strict or conflict with other tools
# HOW: These codes won't trigger warnings
# 
# E203: Whitespace before ':' (conflicts with Black)
# W503: Line break before binary operator (conflicts with Black)
# E501: Line too long (handled by max-line-length)
ignore = E203, W503

# WHAT: Select which error codes to check
# WHY: Focus on important issues
# HOW: Only these categories are checked
#
# E: PEP 8 errors
# W: PEP 8 warnings
# F: PyFlakes errors (undefined names, unused imports)
# C: McCabe complexity
select = E,W,F,C

# WHAT: Maximum cyclomatic complexity
# WHY: Complex functions are hard to understand and test
# HOW: Warning if function complexity exceeds this value
# EXPLANATION: Complexity measures how many paths through your code exist
#              10 means max 10 different paths (if statements, loops, etc.)
max-complexity = 10

# WHAT: Show source code for each error
# WHY: Easier to understand and fix issues
show-source = True

# WHAT: Show statistics at the end
# WHY: See overall code quality metrics
statistics = True

# WHAT: Count errors by type
# WHY: Identify most common issues
count = True

# WHAT: Per-file ignores
# WHY: Some files need specific exceptions
# HOW: Format is "filename:error_code"
